# Simple Search Application

## Task Description

This project implements a simple search form using Vanilla JavaScript and ES6+ features. The application uses a public REST API to search for titles and displays the search results in an autocomplete list. Selected search results are displayed in an editable list below the search component with a date/time stamp. Users can delete individual results or clear the entire list. The application is responsive and adapts to viewport changes.

## What Did I Do

To accomplish the task, I developed a responsive search application with the following features:

1. **Search Form**: Implemented a search form that queries a public REST API for titles.
2. **Autocomplete**: Displayed partial search results in a list beneath the search field for autocomplete functionality.
3. **Editable List**: Displayed selected search results in an editable list with date/time stamps.
4. **Delete Functionality**: Enabled users to delete individual results or clear the entire list.
5. **Responsive Design**: Ensured the application is responsive and adapts to changes in the viewport.

## Technologies I've Used

- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**: For implementing the search functionality and DOM manipulation.
- **HTML5**: For structuring the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling the application and ensuring responsiveness.
